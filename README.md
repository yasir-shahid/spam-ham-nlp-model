This repository contains a machine learning project focused on classifying emails as either SPAM or HAM (non-spam) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, and the application of various classification algorithms to build a robust spam detection model. It demonstrates techniques like tokenization, TF-IDF, and Naive Bayes classification.

Key Features:
Data preprocessing. (removal of stop words, tokenization, etc.)
Feature extraction using TF-IDF
Multiple machine learning models.. (Naive Bayes, SVM, etc.)
Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Easy-to-follow Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts.

This project is ideal for anyone looking to explore text classification and NLP in a practical context.
